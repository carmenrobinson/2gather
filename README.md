# 2gather_DB

Welcome to the 2gather codebase! This repository contains a collection of components that make up the 2gather platform, including a rough outline of our database in Java, a smart contract written in Solidity, and an implementation of an AI recognition model.

## Overview

2gather is a platform that brings communities together by leveraging cutting-edge technology. Our codebase includes the following components:

1. **Database Outline (Java):** A preliminary version of our database structure is implemented in Java. This provides a foundation for data storage and retrieval within our platform.

2. **Smart Contract (Solidity):** We use a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to manage user identities and permissions. This smart contract enables secure and decentralized interactions within our ecosystem.

3. **AI Recognition Model:** Our implementation includes an AI recognition model that uses state-of-the-art techniques to recognize and classify various data points. This model is integral to our platform's functionality.

## Getting Started

Before you can run or modify the code in this repository, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed and contact us first. This is a work in progress and for now we have only made available a preview for investors. Please refer to individual component directories for specific setup instructions.

## Directory Structure

- `/database-outline-java`: Contains the Java-based rough outline of our database.
- `/smart-contract-user-verification`: Contains the Solidity smart contract for identity management on the Ethereum blockchain.
- `/ai-recognition-model`: Contains the code and resources for our AI recognition model.
